# SRWF-Savegame-Editor
This is my personal project that I am planning to finish in 2025 EOY.
Sega Saturn's Super Robot Wars F was released on [September 25, 1997]([url](https://akurasu.net/wiki/Super_Robot_Wars/F#:~:text=Release%20Date%3A,Sony%20PlayStation%3A%20December%2010%2C%201998)) by Banpresto. A port to PS1 was release a year after.

**SRWF-Savegame-Editor** is a Sega Saturn savegame editor for Super Robot Wars F where it's possible to change funds, change unlocked units by another one (Mazinger Z to Mazinkaiser for example), pilot (Kou from GP01 to Hiiro from Gundam Wing for example), upgrades (HP, EN, Mobility, Armor, Limit, weapons), [reinforcement parts]([url](https://akurasu.net/wiki/Super_Robot_Wars/F/Parts)) (Booster, Biosensor, etc) and adding new units and pilots.

Note that this game has 2 different savegames:
* SROBOT_F_00.bin - Saves a history of all seen unit/pilot, karaoke, etc.
* SROBOT_F_01.bin - Saves your progress and that's the file this editor works.

# How to Use
Start by opening a SROBOT_F_01.bin file
Make all desired changes and click Save button to apply.
